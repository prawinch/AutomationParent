Selenium
--------


1. Added Selenium library to the project
2. Added WebdriverManager lib to the project
    Understood the conept of adding the exe information to launch any browser
        - Exe acts as an adaptor between selenium calls and the browser functionality
    By adding webdrivermanager, we save the effort of extractin and adding the exe information manually
    Webdrivermanager helps in setup of browser (hidden: by downloading the exe and setting the path for execution)

3. Started a chrome browser
4. Understood the keywords related to Launch
    (creating an object of the chromedriver launches the browser session)

5. Keyword related to Navigation:
    - get(String s)        -- launches the url (where s is the url)
        Tip: Always use the url including protocol details (in general http/https)
    - navigate()    -- Returns navigation object
        .to(Url/String)
        .back()
        .forward()
        .refresh()

6. Extracted browser component details like URL, Title of the launched site

7. Performed a google search by using the findElement()
    findElement(By by)
        - needs a By information
        By can be   name()  -- covered
                    id()
                    tagName()
                    linkText()
                    partialLinkText()
                    xpath()
                    cssSelector()
                    className()

8. Extracted all Links using findElements()
        This returns a list of webelements
        using the list function, we extraced the total links found on the home page
        Printed the size of the list

        Using for loop --> iterated on each element
            Printed the Text of each link (getText())
            Printed the href of each link (getAttribute("href"))


--------
9. WindowHandles
        Handle is the unique id assigned to the browser when it is laucnhed
        getWindowHandle() will return the id of the browser in focus
            - String is the return type of this function
        getWindowHandles() will return "ALL" ids of the browsers created in the current session
            - Set<String> is the return type of this function


10. SwitchTo()
        allows to switch the focus of the control during execution
                - possible to switch between
                        - active element
                        - windows
                        - alerts
                        - defaultContent
                        - frames

11.

General:
Created a new package for reusability
- BrowserFactory
        : Ideally should contail all the reusable browser fucntions which can be used in any project
